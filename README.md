# StockPredictions

The stock market is considered to be very dynamic and complex in nature.
An accurate prediction of future prices may lead to a higher yield of profit for investors through stock investments. 
As per the predictions, investors will be able to pick the stocks that may give a higher return.

we will discuss the Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network, one of the popular deep learning models,
used in stock market prediction.

In this task, we will fetch the historical data of stock automatically using python libraries and 
fit the LSTM model on this data to predict the future closing prices of the Apple stock.
